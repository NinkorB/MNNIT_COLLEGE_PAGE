    <h2>About the Department</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The Department of Civil Engineering was established in 1961 with an initial intake of 30 students. The first Head of the Department was Prof. S.C. Jain. Initially, classes and labs were held at Allahabad Polytechnic before relocating to the main building in the third year. The department began with five laboratories and later expanded to include more. The intake increased to 70 students, and an M.Tech. program in Structural Engineering and Soil Mechanics was introduced in 1970. Over time, additional M.Tech. specializations were added, and new labs developed. Currently, the department offers four M.Tech. programs: Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Transportation Engineering. It is also recognized as a QIP center for M.Tech. and Ph.D. programs. The department has 41 faculty members, with an intake of 121 B.Tech and 76 M.Tech students.
