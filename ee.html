    <h2>About the Department</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">

The Electrical Engineering Department was established in 1961 with the goal of producing high-quality technical manpower and promoting research. It began with a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) program in 1961, followed by postgraduate programs in Electrical Machines/Power Systems/Control Systems in 1970-71. In 1976-77, the department introduced the first BE degree in Computer Science in the country, followed by the BE in Electronics in 1982-83.

In 1986, the department also launched a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) program. Today, the department offers B.Tech in Electrical Engineering and M.Tech and Ph.D. programs in Power Electronics & Drives, Control & Instrumentation, and Power Systems (available in Regular, Part-Time, and QIP categories). The department is equipped with six specialized labs and is involved in various research projects funded by MNRE, DST, and MHRD. It is also a recognized QIP center for Ph.D. programs for engineering and polytechnic faculty members.
